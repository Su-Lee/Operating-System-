# OS Course Assignments

This repository contains assignments for the course [Operating System].

## MP0: [Tree Command]

Description: This assignment focuses on setting up the environment for the xv6 operating system and developing a custom command called mp0 within it. The cuntom command that has been built with this assignment is the unix tree command. 

### Instructions
- Detailed instructions can be found in the `mp0.pdf` file in the MP0 directory.

## MP1: [Multithreading using setjmp and longjmp]

Description: The objective is to create a system where threads yield CPU time explicitly when not actively executing, facilitating multi-threaded execution. Divided into two parts, Part 1 focuses on core thread management operations like creation, scheduling, yielding, dispatching, and exit handling. Part 2 extends functionality by enabling threads to manage multiple tasks in Last-Come-First-Serve (LCFS) order. Successful completion requires adherence to guidelines, proper utilization of data structures, and thorough testing with provided cases.

### Instructions
- Detailed instructions can be found in the `MP1.pdf` file in the MP1 directory.

## MP2: [Virtual Memory: Page Replacement algorithm]

Description: the assignment aims to deepen our understanding of virtual memory management principles and mechanisms. By working hands-on with the xv6 operating system, we're tasked with gaining practical experience in implementing key concepts such as page tables, page faults handling, and swapping. Additionally, the assignment provides an opportunity to explore and implement different page replacement algorithms, such as FIFO (First-In-First-Out) and LRU (Least Recently Used). Through these tasks, we aim to not only comprehend the theoretical underpinnings of memory management but also develop the practical skills necessary to manipulate and optimize memory usage within an operating system environment. Ultimately, the assignment seeks to equip us with a comprehensive understanding of memory management fundamentals, preparing us for more advanced topics in operating systems and computer architecture.

### Instructions
- Detailed instructions can be found in the `mp2.pdf` file in the MP2 directory.
